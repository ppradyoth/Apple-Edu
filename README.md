# Apple-Edu
This is a Java Project which will display contents of the Apple Education Store.

This is a College Project for Object Oriented Programming with Java

Course Code: IS4C04 

Course Instructor: Mr. Suhaas KP, Assistant Professor, Department of Information Science and Engineering, The National Institute Of Engineering, Mysuru 570008

TOPIC: Apple Education Store Catalogue

AIM: To provide users with the contents of the products available in the Apple Education store at student discounts and to redirect them to the link where they          can buy the product directly from Apple Inc.

Reason for this Project : 
 * Many people are unaware of the presence of Apple's Education Store and hence shy away from Apple Products due to their high pricing which is more than the value    the product has to offer.
 * I am hoping for that to change when people view this program and understand the benefits of Apple Products over others and opt for them if they are interested      and get the Student Discounts!

Concepts Illustrated:
 * Abstraction- Classes. 	  
 * Scope and Lifetime of variables.	 
 * Declaring objects.  	
 * Instance Variables of different data types.	  
 * Constructors/Methods. 	
 * 'this' keyword.  		
 * Inheritance. 		 
 * Overloading (Constructors) 	
 * Overriding.  				
 * Objects as parameters.     
 * Access control mechanism. 		
 * Use of 'super'.				 
 * Packages.  				
 * Interfaces.			
 * Exception Handling. 				
 * Creation of thread to execute a certain process.  
 * Few string handling mechanisms.
 * Usage of URI.

The program is divided into two files in two packages in order to illustrate the concept of Packages in Java.

Project Conclusion: This project successfully completes its 2 primary objectives
                        1. Displays contents of Apple Education store.
                        2. Redirects users to the link where they can buy the product directly from Apple Inc.
